# wallpost
A small script for sending a post to different groups of the social network "Vkontakte". 
The list of groups where the post should be sent should be in the "pablics.txt" file next to the "main.py" file. A summary of the work will be in file "results.txt".

NB: API "Vkontakte" allows no more than 100 posts in one day
